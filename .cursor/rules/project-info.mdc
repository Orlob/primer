Primer – General Project Overview

Primer is an AI-powered Meeting Preparation Engine designed for HubSpot users.
Its purpose is simple:
Turn all CRM activity into a clean, actionable briefing—automatically.

Primer connects directly to HubSpot and pulls the most relevant data for an upcoming meeting, including emails, notes, calls, tasks, deal status, contact details, and timeline events. It analyzes the history, identifies what matters, and generates a structured, blueprint-style prep page that makes every meeting more efficient and more informed.

Primer is built to eliminate “blind meetings” and reduce time spent manually scrolling through CRM entries. Instead of digging through a chaotic timeline, users receive a precise, AI-generated summary tailored to the meeting context.

Primer fits naturally into existing workflows:

Open your calendar

Click the meeting

Primer fetches, analyzes, and prepares your briefing

You enter the meeting fully informed

The product focuses on clarity, reliability, structure, and speed. It is intentionally minimal, with the goal of becoming a trusted “preflight check” for sales calls, onboarding sessions, success check-ins, internal syncs, and any client-facing conversation.

Primer is the foundation—the “first step”—for better meetings.
